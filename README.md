# Project Portfolio
Welcome! This portfolio showcases a selection of my recent projects in technology and business, two areas I'm deeply passionate about. By pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems, I’ve found the perfect way to bring both worlds together.  

Here, you’ll find examples of my work in data analytics, data visualization, and practical tech-driven business solutions. Each project highlights my ability to bridge technical skills with business insights.

## Projects

### [Data Visualization for Citi Bike using Tableau](./Tableau)  
**Year:** 2025  

**Summary:** This was a group project where we collaboratively analyzed Citi Bike usage data using Tableau. We created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends such as usage by day, user type, and trip duration. I contributed to the data exploration and led the design of the PowerPoint presentation, which summarized our key findings and insights.  
**Skills:** Tableau, Data Visualization, Dashboard Design, Team Collaboration, Presentation Development.  

### [Data Analytics using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib](./DataAnalytics)  
**Year:** 2025  

**Summary:** In this project, I acted as a data analyst exploring a real-world movie dataset. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I filtered, sorted, and visualized data to uncover insights about what makes a movie successful — including trends around budgets, revenues, and ratings. The goal was to analyze patterns and present data-backed findings through clean and informative visualizations.  
**Skills:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization.  

### [Maple Syrup Invoice System using Python](./MapleSyrupInvoice)
**Year:** 2025

**Summary:** This beginner-level Python project simulates a real-world order system for a Canadian maple syrup brand, Escuminac. The user is prompted to select syrup types, quantities, and a shipping method, and then receives a complete invoice including shipping cost, GST, and total. This project demonstrates my strong use of functions, user input validation, dictionaries, and formatted output.  
**Skills:** Python, Functions, Input Validation, Dictionaries, JupyterLab, Programming Logic.

### [Hotel Sales Analysis for Paradise Hotels using Excel](./HotelSalesAnalysis)
**Year:** 2024  

**Summary:** This school assignment was based on sales data from Paradise Hotels, a Canadian hotel chain with branches in Ottawa and Toronto. Using Excel, I calculated monthly sales, analyzed KPIs for 2023 based on 2022 performance, and created visual summaries using Sparklines and charts. I also cleaned five years of historical data, built pivot tables, and applied conditional formatting to highlight sales trends. A written report was included to summarize insights and compare performance across both locations.  
**Skills:**  Excel, Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, KPI Analysis, Chart Design, Sparklines, Conditional Formatting, Dashboard Creation, Microsoft Word.

### [Introduction to Python](./Python)
**Year:** 2024  

**Summary:** This individual university assignment involved building five Python programs to apply core programming concepts in a business context. Tasks included calculating compound interest, generating employee paychecks with overtime and tax, converting CAD to USD using real-world exchange rates, and visualizing store sales with asterisks in a bar chart format. I followed structured design, used functions, and documented my work through screenshots and code explanations in a Word report.
**Skills:** Python, Functions, Loops, User Input, Compound Interest Calculation, Currency Conversion, Microsoft Word, Visual Studio Code.
